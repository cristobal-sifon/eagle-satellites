Satellite galaxies and subhaloes in the EAGLE simulation

The purpose of this project is to study the evolution of galaxies and
their dark matter haloes as they become satellites of massive clusters,
be it as centrals or as subhaloes of a smaller system.

### Abstract:

I will assess the change in the density profiles of galaxies as they fall into clusters
using the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulation. This project should serve as a preparation for
the assessment of the validity of the assumptions, and the level of bias that may exist,
in the interpretation of satellite lensing measurements with KiDSxGAMA. Questions may
include: i) where do galaxies come from when they become satellites of massive (M>1e13 Msun)
clusters? ii) what do their density profiles look like before and after they become
satellites of massive clusters? iii) to what extent is the matter content of galaxies
pre-processed (e.g., by smaller associations of galaxies) by the time they are accreted
into massive clusters?
